# 365 days of Arduino

I'm doing a 365 day development challenge of creating/modifying/improving at least 1 Arduino project/program/activity everyday for an entire year.

Not really sure how long this will last but I'll do my best to be consistent.

## Update 1 (06/17/2024)

I'm thinking there should be a weekly and monthly build where I'm going to do a project for an entire week and month. I would also want there be a sort of challenge to use each component in a generic Arduino kit for the next project/activities.
