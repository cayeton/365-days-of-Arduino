# 365 days of Arduino

I'm doing a 365 day development challenge of creating/modifying/improving at least 1 Arduino project/program/activity everyday for an entire year.

Not really sure how long this will last but I'll do my best to be consistent.

## Update 1 (06/17/2024)

I'm thinking there should be a weekly and monthly build where I'm going to do a project for an entire week and month. I would also want there be a sort of challenge to use each component in a generic Arduino kit for the next project/activities.

For external factors like bad internet connection, earthquake, storms, basically Force Majeure, that could result in uploads late by at least a day, I should provide proof (of any sort) that those situations occured.

As much as possible, I want my output for each day to have at least 1 input device/signal and 1 output device/signal.
